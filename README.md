# 2d_physics_engine
A basic 2d physics simulator using c++ and SFML. This project is an ambitious goal of mine that I want to challenge myself to complete. I want this engine to be able to simulate gravity, forces, and collisions between different physics bodies. The engine only keeps track of the mathmatical aspects and keeps track of all the physics bodies in space. Rendering must be done outside of the engine. I will provide a visual demo using SFML to show you what the engine does. This is a work in progress and I have much more work to do.
